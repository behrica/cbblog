<h1>New Clojure library ‘rojure’ released</h1>
<p>I am proud to announce the first version of “rojure”, a R-Clojure bridge using <a href="https://github.com/mikera/core.matrix">clojure.core.matrx</a> and clojure.core.matrix.dataset for data exchange between R and clojure.</p>
<p>Is is a continuation of the ‘rincanter’ project.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jolby/rincanter" class="uri">https://github.com/jolby/rincanter</a></li>
<li>-&gt; <a href="https://github.com/skm-ice/rincanter" class="uri">https://github.com/skm-ice/rincanter</a></li>
<li>-&gt; rojure</li>
</ul>
<p>but replacing the dependency to “incanter” and its data structures with dependencies on “core.matrix”.</p>
<p>So the name change from rincanter to rojure was needed.</p>
<p>The code is now completely independent from incanter, but can be of course used from incanter (&gt; 1.9.0) as well.</p>
<p>The first version is released on clojars: <a href="https://clojars.org/rojure" class="uri">https://clojars.org/rojure</a></p>
<p>The code is available on GitHub : <a href="https://github.com/behrica/rojure" class="uri">https://github.com/behrica/rojure</a></p>
<p>As it is only a small modification from rincanter, it should be rather stable already.</p>
<p>I welcome every type of commnents in the issues: <a href="https://github.com/behrica/rojure/issues" class="uri">https://github.com/behrica/rojure/issues</a></p>
